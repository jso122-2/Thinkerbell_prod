# Enhanced Thinkerbell Data Pipeline

## Overview

This enhanced data pipeline addresses overfitting in the Thinkerbell sentence encoder by expanding the label space and introducing complexity variations. The original problem was a trivial classification task with only 5 unique label combinations for 1,387 chunks, leading to perfect memorization.

## Problem Statement

**Original Issues:**
- Only 5 unique label combinations across 1,387 samples
- Strong, repetitive text patterns within each combination
- Model achieved near-perfect accuracy through memorization
- Trivial classification task that didn't generalize well

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Label Space Expansion (`enhanced_labeling_system.py`)

**Sub-Labels:** Each base label is expanded into 3-4 sub-labels:
- `brand` → `brand_name`, `brand_type`, `brand_category`, `brand_mention`
- `campaign` → `campaign_type`, `campaign_timeline`, `campaign_scope`, `campaign_platform`
- `deliverables` → `content_type`, `content_count`, `content_format`, `content_quality`
- And more...

**Content-Specific Labels:** Platform and format-specific labels:
- Social media: `instagram_post`, `instagram_story`, `facebook_post`, etc.
- Content types: `photo`, `video`, `story`, `reel`, `live_stream`
- Quality levels: `professional`, `user_generated`, `lifestyle`

**Complexity Levels:** Four difficulty tiers:
- **Minimal** (1-3 labels): Simple, focused samples
- **Moderate** (3-6 labels): Standard complexity
- **Complex** (5-9 labels): Multi-faceted samples
- **Comprehensive** (7+ labels): Full-spectrum samples

### 2. Multi-Label Samples

**Strategy:** Combine 2-3 chunks with overlapping content to create samples requiring broader associations.

**Implementation:**
- Groups chunks by content similarity
- Combines text snippets intelligently
- Merges label sets for complex multi-label targets
- 25% of dataset becomes multi-label by default

### 3. Distractor Class ("None of the Above")

**Categories:** Realistic negative samples from different domains:
- Employment contracts
- Real estate agreements
- Financial documents
- Legal proceedings
- Academic materials
- Medical records
- Technical specifications

**Purpose:** Forces model to learn what influencer marketing content is NOT, preventing false positives.

### 4. Proportional Distribution Maintenance (`enhanced_split_chunks.py`)

**Stratified Splitting:** Maintains label distribution across train/val/test splits using:
- Complexity-based stratification
- Sample type balancing (original/multi-label/distractor)
- Label count distribution preservation

## Usage

### 1. Generate Enhanced Dataset

```bash
# Run complete enhanced pipeline
python run_enhanced_pipeline.py

# Custom parameters
python run_enhanced_pipeline.py \
  --distractor-ratio 0.2 \
  --multi-label-ratio 0.3 \
  --stratify-by complexity
```

### 2. Train Enhanced Model

```bash
# Train with enhanced features
python enhanced_train_encoder.py

# Custom training
python enhanced_train_encoder.py \
  --epochs 6 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --no-hard-negatives
```

### 3. Demo System

```bash
# See how enhancement works
python demo_enhanced_system.py
```

## Results

### Label Space Expansion
- **Original:** 5 unique combinations
- **Enhanced:** 50+ unique combinations (10x increase)
- **Total label space:** 97 possible labels

### Sample Diversity
- **Multi-label samples:** 25% of dataset
- **Distractor samples:** 15% of dataset  
- **Complexity distribution:** 4 difficulty levels

### Training Improvements
- **Hard negative mining:** Prevents easy memorization
- **Complexity-aware evaluation:** Tracks performance across difficulty levels
- **Overfitting detection:** Warns about suspicious patterns

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Labeling Process

1. **Text Analysis:** Extract relevant patterns from chunk text
2. **Base Label Mapping:** Map original labels to base categories
3. **Sub-Label Extraction:** Add granular sub-labels based on content
4. **Content Classification:** Add platform/format-specific labels
5. **Complexity Assignment:** Determine difficulty level and filter labels accordingly

### Multi-Label Generation

1. **Content Grouping:** Group chunks by similar content types
2. **Intelligent Combination:** Merge 2-3 chunks with overlapping themes
3. **Label Fusion:** Combine label sets from source chunks
4. **Text Generation:** Create coherent combined text

### Distractor Generation

1. **Template-Based:** Use realistic templates from different domains
2. **Variable Substitution:** Fill templates with domain-appropriate data
3. **Quality Control:** Ensure realistic but clearly distinct content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No enhanced data found"**
   - Run `python run_enhanced_pipeline.py` first
   - Check that input directory contains original splits

2. **"Validation accuracy too high"**
   - Increase distractor ratio: `--distractor-ratio 0.25`
   - Add more hard negatives in training

3. **"Label distribution imbalanced"**
   - Try different stratification: `--stratify-by sample_type`
   - Adjust complexity distribution in `enhanced_labeling_system.py`

### Performance Tuning

- **Increase complexity:** Higher distractor ratio, more sub-labels
- **Improve balance:** Adjust stratification method
- **Enhance negatives:** Tune hard negative mining parameters

## Future Enhancements
