In the event the Work is not accepted, Agency shall provide clear instructions to the Talent regarding the issue so that it may be rectified (where possible). If the work can not be rectified and therefore, not accepted or published, Agency reserves the right to not pay the entire agreed-upon fee as stated in the contract. If the Work is acceptable to Agency, Agency shall provide written confirmation of this to the Talent as soon as is practicable. 1.8 Agency may request changes to the Work or request that the Work be removed or amended after it has been published for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, if Agency receives a complaint regarding the Work, or if the material is inconsistent with Client's brand ideals. If Agency makes such a request, Talent and Agency must discuss in good faith (and Talent shall make) changes reasonably requested by Agency. 1.9 Agency may, in its discretion and despite accepting the Work, and notwithstanding the Usage Rights, decide not to publish any Work provided by the Talent pursuant to this Agreement. 1.10 Agency shall have the right to use the Talent's name in connection with the Work where that Work is used and published in Media 1.11 Agency has final editorial control over any materials produced by Agency utilising or incorporating the Works. 2. SERVICES AND PAYMENT TERMS 2.1 In consideration for the proper provision of the Services, the Agency will pay the Talent the Fee in accordance with the Commercial terms, subject to receipt of a valid tax invoice from the Talent, and shall procure the delivery of the Other Consideration (if applicable). 2.2 All Fee amounts are in Australian dollars, unless otherwise specified. 2.3 The Fee shall be exclusive of GST and inclusive of any commission due to any of the Talent's agents, advisers or regulatory bodies, and also inclusive of any deductions and other liabilities the Agency or any other agency may be required to make under state or federal law including but not limited to the federal income tax legislation and state payroll tax legislation. The Fee shall be made gross and without deduction of income or other related taxes or superannuation guarantee contributions (\"SGC\") in respect of the Talent. The Talent as a sole trader and self-employer acknowledges and agrees that it is an independent contractor of the Agency and will be solely responsible for the payment or withholding of any PAYG tax, SGC, workers compensation, payroll tax and all other such liabilities as required in respect of the Fee and the engagement hereunder at current prevailing rates under applicable income tax, superannuation, state payroll tax and other relevant legislation. 2.3 In the event that the Talent fails to complete all agreed-upon deliverables as outlined in this contract, the Agency shall be entitled to pay the Talent only 50% of the total agreed-upon fee. Alternatively, the payment may be adjusted to reflect the percentage of deliverables completed, with a maximum payment not exceeding 50% of the total fee.
